## How to initiate a new repo to an existing local repo



#### 1 - Whether on Bitbucket or Github, when sending a local repo to the cloud, create a new repo under these storage sites but without a readme file, for you will get an error of fetch master, where you'd have to pull request the online repo to your current local repo



####2 - On  your local repo set on the reminal within the local repo

####`git remote add origin https://Topikz@bitbucket.org/Example/example.git`

#### 3 - Afterwards set in terminal `git push -u origin master`
